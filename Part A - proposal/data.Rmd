# Data

## Accident 

A data set with anonymized information from government of all road accidents in Victoria, Australia from 2006 until 2020 is used \citep*{department-of-transport-2006}. The data provided allows users to analyse Victorian fatal and injury crash data based on time, location, conditions, crash type, road user type, object hit etc.

## Weather

Weather datasets contains about daily weather observations describing daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperature and precipitation for the year of 2006 - 2020 from many locations across Australia. We collected the data using the Visual Crossing Weather API to perform a preliminary exploration to determine what, if any, predictive value weather has on crash and injury data when analyzed at the level of incident.
