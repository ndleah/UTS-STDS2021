# Introduction

Death, injury and disability from road traffic crashes (RTCs) continue to be major global public health problems. A road traffic crash results from a combination of factors related to the components of the system comprising roads, the environment, vehicles and road users, and the way they interact. Identifying the risk factors that contribute to road traffic crashes is important in identifying interventions that can reduce the risks associated with those factors.   

The aim of this study is to investigate the possible associations between some environmental factors and the increased risk of motor vehicle crash-related mortality in Victoria, Australia. Next, our group will try to predict the number of fatalities based on those factors.
