## üìÅ Repo Navigations

The `data` folder contains all datasets available for analyis in the report. It contains:
* **ACCIDENT:** Datasets were made available from the [Traffic Accident Database System by Victoria Roads](https://vicroadsopendatastorehouse.vicroads.vic.gov.au/opendata/Road_Safety/ACCIDENT.zip) for the period between **2006-2020**.
* **weather_data:** Weather datasets collected from 3rd party API from 2006 - 2020. 

The `Part A - Proposal` folder contains all elements needed to generate the first part of the proposal.

The `Part B - Report` folder contains all elements needed to generate the complete report.

`bibliography.bib` contains sample references on Fratercula arctica (Atlantic puffins), written in BibTex format.

## üìç `.Rmd` files dictionary
All the `.Rmd` files here correspond to the different sections of the dissertation, which are going to be merged together into the final report during the tutorial to create the complete dissertation structure:

## ‚úçÔ∏è In-text Citation and References

> In our report, I use `natbib` package for generating our references. 

All our raw references are written in BibTex format. If you cite an academic paper, you can download the citation under `.bib` file or if the source isn't available BibTex downloadable format, you can manually generate it by one of reference management tools (I use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)).

### üìù Things to do
There are 2 things you need to carefully keep in mind when working with this citation package, ensure to:
* Input your citation (BibTex format) in the `bibliography.bib`
* Cite your in-text citation in a **right format/command** 
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Or else, your reference will not display in the final reference list, even when you already included it in the `bibliography.bib` file**)

### ‚ùì How to cite the in-text citation?

If you open `bibliography.bib`, each citation is structured as such:

``` r
@article{breton_encounter_2006,
	title = {Encounter, Survival, and Movement Probabilities from an Atlantic Puffin (fratercula Arctica) Metapopulation},
	volume = {76},
	rights = {¬© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America},
	issn = {1557-7015},
	url = {https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/05-0704},
	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1890/05-0704},
	abstract = {...},
}
```

You can see the citation starts with an @, followed by curly brackets, which contain the **citation key**, and other information relevant to the article (such as title, abstract, author, date etc.).

Try to write a few in-line citations in any section of the dissertation that you‚Äôd like. For example, with these command:

``` r
\citep{breton_encounter_2006}

\citep*{breton_encounter_2006}

\citet{breton_encounter_2006}

\citet*{breton_encounter_2006}

\citep{martin_diet_1989, breton_encounter_2006}

\citeauthor{breton_encounter_2006}

\citeauthor*{breton_encounter_2006}

\citeyear{breton_encounter_2006}

\citeyearpar{breton_encounter_2006}
```

...the output after knitting the document will look like this:
